# Transmission

A game made by me and four other colleagues for the 2017 Global Game Jam.

The challange was to make a game in 48 hours, with the theme transmission.

We created a 2D puzzle platformer, with a core transmission mechanic. 

I specfically worked on collisions, light physics,  light movement, pairtial level desgin, and animations.
